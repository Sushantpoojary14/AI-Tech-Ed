Options: a. 10 years, 25 years b. 8 years, 17 years c. 7 years, 14 years d. 6 years, 13 years Answer: B Explanation: Let Jill's age be x. Then, Jack's age is 2x - 5. The sum of their ages is x + (2x - 5) = 35. Combining like terms, we get 3x - 5 = 35. Adding 5 to both sides, we have 3x = 40. Dividing both sides by 3, we find x = 40/3. Therefore, Jill's age is approximately 13.33 years. Substituting this back into 2x - 5, we get Jack's age to be approximately 17.67 years. Since we cannot have fractions for ages, the closest answer choice is (B) 8 years, 17 years.

      },
      "Answer": "b",
